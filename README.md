# HealthSaathi  
**A Simple Healthcare App for Senior Citizens**

## About the Project  
HealthSaathi is an easy-to-use Android app designed for senior citizens to simplify healthcare. It helps users order medicines by uploading prescriptions, call their doctor with a single tap, and share their location instantly during emergencies.

We built this app with simplicity and usability in mind, ensuring that seniors can access essential healthcare services without any hassle.
